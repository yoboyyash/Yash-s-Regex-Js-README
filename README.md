### Description <a name="description"></a>
In this Regex Tutorial, you'll delve into validating the highlighted regular expression (regex) for email addresses. Regex Featured in This Tutorial: /^([a-z0-9_.-]+)@([\da-z.-]+).([a-z.]{2,6})$/. The tutorial breaks down each part of the regex, making validation straightforward and clear. By the end, you'll grasp how the regex works to ensure the input matches a valid email address.

### Installation

Firstly, sign in to your GitHub account or create one if you don't have it yet. Then, go to https://gist.github.com/ to initiate a new Gist. In the "Gist description" field, provide a concise title for the challenge. Proceed to add a new file to the Gist by selecting "Add file" and assigning it an appropriate name. Within your freshly created Gist, offer a brief breakdown of the regex, elucidating each component and its role in the email validation procedure. Additionally, discuss potential modifications to the regex to accommodate new requirements, such as permitting uppercase letters or additional special characters in the email address. Once the explanation and modifications are complete, save your Gist by opting for either "Create public Gist" or "Create secret Gist" according to your preference. Share the link to your Gist with others to foster discussions on diverse approaches and interpretations of the regex. By tackling this challenge, you'll not only enhance your comprehension of the email validation regex but also gain proficiency in establishing and disseminating a GitHub Gist.
